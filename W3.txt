1.
with open("File_name") as myfile:
    head = [next(myfile) for x in range(n)]
print (head)

2. - I don't know if this one works, becouse it makes an invalid syntax error when I am trying to run any script with this tipe of command - python find_vowels.py 'hello world'
import sys
def count_vowels(n):
    count_vowels = 0
    for char in n:
        if char in 'aouie':
            count_vowels += 1
    print (n, " contains ", count_vowels, " vowels")

count_vowels (sys)

def count_lines (file_name):
    with open(file_name) as myfile:
        count = sum(1 for line in myfile)
    print (count)
count_lines ("island1.txt")

4. There is a bug here and I don't know what does it count
def count_occurrence(file_name, x):
    occurrence = 0
    with open (file_name) as myfile:
         for x in file_name:
                if x in file_name:
                    occurrence += 1
    print (occurrence)
    
count_occurrence ("stuff.txt", "apple")

def copy_file(file_name, file_name2):
    with open(file_name) as f:
        with open(file_name2, 'w') as f1:
            for text in f:
                f1.write(text)
copy_file('island1.txt', 'ff.txt')
